##Goal of the project

This peer graded assignment consists of two parts.First,we will create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers.Second, we will use Slidify or Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about your application.

##Steps to be taken

###1. Write a shiny application with associated supporting documentation. The documentation should be thought of as whatever a user will need to get started using your application.
###2. Deploy the application on Rstudio's shiny server
###3. Share the application link by pasting it into the provided text box
###4. Share your server.R and ui.R code on github

## How to use the application

Using the data provided by Galton Families dataset, we fit a linear model to predict a child's height based on the gender and parent's average height.


ui.R, and Server.R Code in my github repository (https://github.com/yashBhardwaJ09/week4PROJ_DDP)

## Plot
```{r plot,warning=FALSE}
library(HistData)
##The data used in the app comes from the GaltonFamilies dataset. 
data(GaltonFamilies)
library(HistData)
data(GaltonFamilies)
plot(jitter(GaltonFamilies$childHeight) ~ GaltonFamilies$midparentHeight,xlab="Average Height of the Parents (in inches)",ylab="Height of the Child (in inches)",main="Scatterplot of Galton Family Data",pch=19,frame.plot=FALSE,col=ifelse(GaltonFamilies$gender=="female", "pink", "light blue"))
legend(65,80,pch=c(19,19),col=c("pink","light blue"),c("female", "male"),bty="o",cex=.8)
```
